20081212: Wikipedia links to Hindman's theorem, Ramsey theory, and ultrafilters deleted. This is in correspondance with the later abstracts.
20081114: one page or two? Abstracts missing.
20081031: after BMS Friday?
20080717 and other places: I would omit the (almost meta-)link where Peter Krautzberger's comment leads
20080522: there are actually two subtitles:
"und was kann man damit anstellen" in the talk list
"und was kann man damit anfangen" on the talk page
I just kept the first one, but we can discuss it.
20080609: I have no idea how to download the gifs.

20101022 and 20110218: there are slides resp. a handout for the talk, but hidden behind a ZEDAT account wall. Can somebody help migrating, please?
20101029, 20101112, 20110128: link to speakers are still valid; should we add them?
